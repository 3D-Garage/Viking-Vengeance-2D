# My 2D Unity Game Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for my 2D Unity game. This project is under development and we welcome collaborators. I'm also relatively new to Unity, so if you find the initial setup overwhelming, don't worryâ€”you're not alone. Most of the time, I also find myself searching for answers online. Feel free to ask questions or contribute to this project. This README aims to guide you through the setup process and give you an overview of the project.

## Branching Strategy

**Protected Branches:**
- `master`: This is the production branch. Merging into this branch is restricted.
- `dev`: This is the development branch. All feature branches should be merged into this branch.

**Workflow:**

1. **Creating a new branch**: Always create a new branch for a feature or bugfix. 
2. **Changing Branch Source**: After creating the branch, click on "Change branch source" and select `dev` as the source branch.
3. **Opening in GitHub Desktop**: It's advisable to choose the "Open branch with GitHub Desktop" option for better branch management.

## Issue Tracking

Before starting any development work, you should:

1. Search for an existing issue related to the problem or feature you are working on.
2. If no issue exists, create a new issue describing the problem or feature.
3. Assign yourself to the issue.
4. Create a new branch linked to the issue following the [Branching Strategy] and [Workflow].

- **Animations**: Contains all animation-related files.
